      "body": "April 8, 2023\nThe findings suggest a unique role of cardiac dynamics in the momentary experience of time.\nHow long is the present? The answer, Cornell researchers suggest in a new study, depends on your heart.\nThe researchers discovered that our moment-to-moment perception of time is not constant and can expand or contract with each heartbeat.\nAccording to Adam K. Anderson, a professor in the Department of Psychology and College of Human Ecology, the research provides further evidence supporting the idea that the heart is one of the brains key timekeepers and has a fundamental impact on our perception of the passing of time. This is an idea that has been pondered since ancient times.\nTime is a dimension of the universe and a core basis for our experience of self, Anderson said. Our research shows that the moment-to-moment experience of time is synchronized with, and changes with, the length of a heartbeat.\nSaeedeh Sadeghi, M.S. 19, a doctoral student in the field of psychology, is the lead author of a study recently published in the journal Psychophysiology. Anderson is a co-author with Eve De Rosa, the Mibs Martin Follett Professor in Human Ecology (CHE) and dean of faculty at Cornell, and Marc Wittmann, senior researcher at the Institute for Frontier Areas of Psychology and Mental Health in Germany.\nTime perception typically has been tested over longer intervals, when research has shown that thoughts and emotions may distort our sense time, perhaps making it fly or crawl. Sadeghi and Anderson recently reported, for example,\nthat crowding made a simulated train ride seem to pass more slowly.\nSuch findings, Anderson said, tend to reflect how we think about or estimate time, rather than our direct experience of it in the present moment.\nTo investigate that more direct experience, the researchers asked if our perception of time is related to physiological rhythms, focusing on natural variability in heart rates. The cardiac pacemaker ticks steadily on average, but each interval between beats is a tiny bit longer or shorter than the preceding one, like a secondhand clicking at different intervals.\nThe team harnessed that variability in a novel experiment. Forty-five study participants  ages 18 to 21, with no history of heart trouble  were monitored with electrocardiography, or ECG, measuring heart electrical activity at millisecond resolution. The ECG was linked to a computer, which enabled brief tones lasting 80-180 milliseconds to be triggered by heartbeats. Study participants reported whether tones were longer or shorter relative to others.\nThe results revealed what the researchers called temporal wrinkles. When the heartbeat preceding a tone was shorter, the tone was perceived as longer. When the preceding heartbeat was longer, the sounds duration seemed shorter.\nThese observations systematically demonstrate that the cardiac dynamics, even within a few heartbeats, is related to the temporal decision-making process, the authors wrote.\nThe study also showed the brain influencing the heart. After hearing tones, study participants focused their attention on the sounds. That orienting response changed their heart rate, affecting their experience of time.\nThe heartbeat is a rhythm that our brain is using to give us our sense of time passing, Anderson said. And that is not linear  it is constantly contracting and expanding.\nThe scholars said the connection between time perception and the heart suggests our momentary perception of time is rooted in bioenergetics, helping the brain manage effort and resources based on changing body states including heart rate.\nThe research shows, Anderson said, that in subsecond intervals too brief for conscious thoughts or feelings, the heart regulates our experience of the present.\nEven at these moment-to-moment intervals, our sense of time is fluctuating, he said. A pure influence of the heart, from beat to beat, helps create a sense of time.\nReference: Wrinkles in subsecond time perception are synchronized to the heart by Saeedeh Sadeghi, Marc Wittmann, Eve De Rosa and Adam K. Anderson, 2 March 2023, Psychophysiology.",

      "body": "Copy article link\nSave\nOLYMPIA  A Senate Democrat said Friday he will withdraw a bill to refund cap-and-trade surcharges to farmers, citing opposition on several fronts, including from farm groups.\nThe bill also faced a cool reception by the House and was opposed by Gov. Jay Inslee, said Sen. Mark Mullet, D-Issaquah. The bill was scheduled for a committee hearing April 10, but will be pulled from the agenda, he said.\n\"I threw up the white flag of defeat,\" Mullet said.\nThe Climate Commitment Act exempts fuel used to grow and transport farm goods. Fees attributed to the law, however, have been filtering down through a complicated fuel supply chain to farmers.\nRepublican lawmakers pushed unsuccessfully for refunds for several weeks. Mullet and Sen. Joe Nguyen, D-Seattle, introduced a refund bill at the beginning of the week, but farm group lobbyists came out against it.\nThe bill would not have fully refunded carbon fees farmers shouldn't be paying at all, Washington State Dairy Federation President Dan Wood said.\n\"When you're making laws, you need to mean what you say,\" Wood said. \"Exemption means 'zero.' \"\nInslee spokesman Mike Faulk confirmed the governor's office opposed the bill. Oil suppliers are not obligated to buy allowances to cover emissions from farm fuels, he said in an email.\n\"The money farmers and others have paid in surcharges for exempt fuels is not with the state  it is with the oil companies,\" Faulk wrote. \"To use state funds to pay farmers for money collected by oil companies is bad public policy.\"\nThe oil industry says the Department of Ecology hasn't written rules to make applying the exemption possible.\nDigital subscription only $5/mth\nMullet blames Ecology for not doing its job, while Nguyen accuses oil companies of misapplying the law. They agreed farmers should at least get refunds out of cap-and-trade auction proceeds.\nRefunds were to be based on the most-recent price of allowances. If the bill were in effect today, the refunds would be 38.8 cents a gallon for gasoline or diesel.\nWood said farmers are paying more. \"Everybody would be left holding a bag of some size,\" he said.\nUnlike with a direct tax, there is no sure way to know how much cap-and-trade is costing fuel buyers. It's up to fuel suppliers to tell customers whether they are passing on all, some or none of the costs of buying allowances.\nThe Mullet-Nguyen bill would have made it a violation of the state's Consumer Protection Act for businesses to call out cap-and-trade surcharges on fuel bills. The ban would have applied to all fuels, not just farm fuels.\nMullet called the provision \"problematic,\" but that it was important to Nguyen, chairman of the House Environment and Energy Committee.\nNguyen's spokeswoman Erin Hunt said in a text that oil companies are being deceptive if they list cap-and-trade surcharges.\n\"They don't know the cost of compliance, so to say these surcharges are the cost of compliance is deceptive,\" she wrote.\nWood said Nguyen's provision was another reason to oppose the bill since it would have further obscured the cost of cap-and-trade.\nWestern States Petroleum Association spokesman Kevin Slagle said cap-and-trade costs shouldn't be a surprise.  \"We don't believe there is a circumstance where hiding the cost of the cap-and-trade program is good for the public,\" he said.\nSign up for our Top Stories newsletter\nSuccess!

      "body": "Email\nOne of three electric buses at Highline Public Schools near Seattle, Washington, receives its charge.\nHighline School District serving the Seattle suburb of Burien, Washington is in the process of replacing its aging gasoline and clean diesel school buses with new all-electric school buses (ESB).\nTo date, Highline owns three ESBs and officials report that they are running well. The district is also in the process of obtaining an additional three buses. Devin Denney, director of transportation, explained that Highline obtained the first three ESBs through the Volkswagen Mitigation Trust Fund Settlement. The next three ESBs are expected soon via Washington State Department of Ecology clean diesel grants, he added.\nHighline unsuccessfully applied last year for the first round of the five-year, $5 billion U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys Clean School Bus Program (CSBP). Denney said the district was informed that it didnt meet the priority requirements based on low-income rural and tribal area U.S. Census data, Denney explained.\nRelated:\nEPA Announces Recipients of Clean School Bus Program Rebate Awards\nThe EPA selected four Washington districts to receive a total of seven ESBs. Upcoming funds for year two of the EPA CSBP are expected to be announced this spring.\nIn all, 87 ESBs are in operation or earmarked to be for 40 school districts and First Student, with nearly all originating from the VW or state clean diesel grants, according to the Washington State Department of Ecology.\nHighline expects to receive EPA CSBP round two funding, Denney said. The district might also explore the business model offered by companies like Highland Electric Fleets, which covers the upfront cost of ESBs and all charging infrastructure, in exchange for entering a long-term contract\nConstruction of the battery-charging infrastructure for Highline School Districts first three ESBs is complete, but three more chargers are needed for the next three ESBs, to be purchased as soon as possible. And the district plans to acquire them one at a time.\nSince we can only purchase one bus at a time, it makes better sense to purchase and install our chargers one at a time, for each bus, Denney shared, adding the district prefers to obtain the funding sooner and complete the purchasing program faster. The main thing is that we need to be sure we have enough power for each new bus, so we can bring it online and integrate them into our existing system. As of now, we do have enough power and the means to charge our three EV buses, but that will change as we receive the next three.\nOtherwise, implementing the three ESBs into the fleet has gone smoothly. Thats because we already have plenty of power at our charging site, so we havent experienced any challenges so far, noted Denney. Well see how it goes with the next three and so on, until we have all of them replaced with EVs.\nIn 2019, Franklin Pierce School District in nearby Tacoma was the first school district in Washington to purchase ESBs, funded by a grant developed from a 2011 agreement between the state and TransAlta to begin ceasing coal-fired operations at the Centralia power plant.\nWe currently have one Blue Bird EV and it is working well on the route its assigned to  six schools in the mornings, and six schools in the afternoons, said Tim Bridgeman, the districts director of transportation. All of our issues were small, and they have been resolved.\nWith regard to infrastructure, Bridgeman said no new infrastructure was needed for the first bus.\nOur Clipper Creek 100 charger is in place, and its running well. Since we have six more on order, we have begun the process to upgrade our transformer and to install three fast chargers, he shared.\nBridgeman said Franklin Pierce is very satisfied with the change from gasoline and diesel-powered buses to ESBs. Surprisingly, it was seamless, with a small amount of training for the driver, but other than that it went smoothly, he added.\nHow do the students and their parents like the new buses?\nStudents like using the buses because theyre so quiet. They dont have to talk over the engine, Bridgeman concluded. The driver also mentioned that its less stressful for him because of the difference in noise level.\nRelated:\nHave staff salaries increased this school year to keep up with inflation?\nYes",

Image Credit: ANI\nCountry:\nUnited States\nSHARE\nRecent research reveals a technique to avoid age-related weight increase, which might prevent obesity and related health problems like Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and chronic inflammation. By stimulating the production of a certain type of fat cells, the effects of a slowing metabolism could be reversed, according to a new study by researchers in Cornell's Division of Nutritional Sciences, which is housed in the College of Human Ecology and the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.\nMammals, including humans, have two main types of fat: white adipose tissue (WAT), which stores energy from excess calorie intake, and brown adipose tissue (BAT), which burns calories to produce heat to maintain body temperature. The study, published in Nature Communications, shows therapeutic promise in a third type of fat, a subtype of WAT: beige fat. Beige fat has the same cellular precursors as white fat and the same thermogenic properties as brown fat, which means it helps to reduce blood sugar and the fatty acids that cause hardening of the arteries and heart disease.\nWhen a person experiences sustained exposure to cold temperatures, stem cells known as adipose progenitor cells form thermogenic beige fat cells within white fat. As people age, the response to that stimulus weakens, tipping the balance toward white fat production. \"There are seasonal changes in beige fat in young humans,\" said Dan Berry, assistant professor in the Division of Nutritional Sciences, \"but an older person would have to stand outside in the snow in their underwear to get those same effects.\"\nIn earlier work, Berry observed that the aging process impairs the formation of beige fat cells in response to cold temperatures. Identify the biochemistry behind the slowdown, he said, and the same process could be reversed to achieve therapeutic outcomes. \"This is the ultimate goal,\" said Abigail Benvie, lead author of the new study and a doctoral student researcher in Berry's lab. \"Without having to subject people to cold exposure for prolonged periods of time, are there metabolic pathways we can stimulate that could produce the same effect?\"\nIn the paper, they reveal the role of a specific signaling pathway that suppresses beige fat formation in older mice by antagonizing the immune system. By suppressing that pathway in aging mice, the scientists were able to prompt beige fat production in animals that otherwise formed only in WAT.

(WOOD)  A new immersive, hands-on course at Muskegon Community College is taking a close look at freshwater ecology.\nThe Aquatic Ecology course introduces students to the processes that occur in local bodies of water, including the Great Lakes. Students will attend online classes once a week. There will also be a week-long intensive field experience at the Central Michigan University biological station on Beaver Island.\nWe live in the Great Lakes region. The Great Lakes are an important part of our economy, our way of life, even our identity here in Michigan. So, I think all of us as citizens should know the importance of clean water and how to take care of it, how to make decisions for the health of our aquatic ecosystems, said Matt Cooper, instructor of life sciences at Muskegon Community College. I think everyone should take something like this just to educate themselves in the importance of fresh water.\nHe said the goal is to introduce students to all types of aquatic ecologies.\nSo, water chemistry, the physics of water as well as the biology. And the students that will take the course are generally those that dont have any  previous experience in ecology.\nThe course will be available this summer, beginning in June. You can enroll and find more information on MCCs website.\nCopyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

      "body": "6:37 PM PDT April 6, 2023\nUpdated:\n6:37 PM PDT April 6, 2023\nSPOKANE, Wash.  Ohio. Washington. Montana.\nTrain derailments in these three states in the last two months have been talking points for people across the country to discuss railroad safety.\nBNSF locomotive engineer Shawn Blackburn said despite the national attention derailments are getting, derailments are actually common.\n\"\nOn average, theres a derailment like everyday somewhere, Blackburn said.\nThe severity and environmental impact of a derailment is what can cause more people to focus on one derailment over another.\n\"There was one in Ohio that made the news,\" Blackburn said. \"It was really bad on the environment. Really bad for the people in that town.\nSo now there's an increased focus, could this be a thing? And the truth is, it could be a thing for your town. It could be a thing for any town.\nWhen a spill does occur in Washington, the Department of Ecology is one of the responding agencies.\nResponse section manager Dave Byer said 4,500 spills happen in the state every year.\n\"Our initial efforts are going to look like community monitoring and worker safety monitoring,\" Byer started. \"We're going to take initial source control and containment activities to stop additional materials from leaking into the environment and from posing as a health threat to the local population, or the local resources, whether cultural or environmental resources in our state waters. And then, we're going to work towards a detailed sampling and analysis to characterize the extent and nature of can combination that might be left behind.\"\nByer said the state works with railroad partners to prepare ahead of potential disasters.\n\"\nWashington is one of the very few states that has required our rail industry that's transporting the risk to prepare detailed spill contingency plans, outlining what they're going to do and how they're prepared to respond in the event of a spill, Byer said.\nStill, this doesn't stop people from talking.\n\"\nOhio is in people's minds, and so you have a derailment, they want to know, is this going to be the same thing? Are we going to have fire plumes of smoke? Are we evacuating people?,\" Spills program communications manager Ty Kelter said. \"So it just these big incidents really put those things on people's minds at the time.\"\nBut Blackburn doesn't sugarcoat the potential for a serious incident to happen anywhere, at any time.\n\"Every day of the week, there's at least two or three trains where one tank car could kill thousands,\" Blackburn said. \"I don't think people should be quaking in their boots about a possible derailment. These tracks have been here since the 1800s, they're going to be here tomorrow and so are we. It's just part of doing business. Trains have to get through.\"\nBlackburn said when it comes to discussing train safety, he thinks the focus should on train length.\n\"Train length has gotten completely out of hand,\" Blackburn said. \"\nA train will stop here inSpokaneand another will come up behind it and attach to it. Then theyll make one giant train out of two. So next time youre at a crossing and you see four miles oftrain, just hope it doesnt break.\n\nBlackburn said addressing train length and doing more inspections of rail cars could help prevent future derailments from becoming national concerns.\nRelated Articles\nHard cleanup: Montana train derailment spills beer and clay\nFiery train derailment in Minnesota prompts evacuations\nBNSF train derails in Anacortes, causing diesel spill\nKREM ON SOCIAL MEDIA:",

      "description": "Toxic Blue Green Algae Detected in Lake Marcel August 9, 2016\nMarch 6, 2016\nWarning  Toxic Algae Present in Lake Marcel\nThe King County Environmental Laboratory found concentrations above the state recreational guideline that are potentially dangerous for human health. Scums or accumulation of toxic algae were found near Beach 2, but they may be found in other areas of the lake because the blooms float and are moved easily by the wind.\nAdvice for people and dogs:\nPeople and dogs should not swim, wade, or play in the lake if a blue-green algae or scum is present. Dog owners should not allow their dogs to have any contact with the water if there is an accumulation of algae nearby. If a dog has contact with an algae bloom, do not let them lick their fur, rinse the dog with clean water, and then rinse your hands and any exposed skin.\nWarning signs:\nVisitors to the lake are advised to watch for warning signs, which will be updated as conditions change. However, because wind can blow scums rapidly from one part of the lake to another, people should avoid water that appears to have algae even if there are no warning signs present.  Local and state staff will continue to sample for toxicity until the bloom ends.\nPotential health impact:\nToxic blue-green algae can affect humans and make animals very ill, even proving fatal to dogs if ingested in large quantities. If swallowed, the algal toxin (microcystin) may cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and in some cases, severe liver toxicity.  Some people or dogs may be sensitive to touching the toxins and have mouth or nose irritation and skin rash. King County works with the Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology) on an algae identification and testing program for lakes with frequent algae blooms. Statewide data and more information about toxic cyanobacteria can be found at:\nA follow-up email will be sent with the results of the next test.\nFiled Under:",

It's crazy.\"\nWatching mounds of garbage pile up in his community, Sweeny, a Port of Seattle firefighter, decided not to complain but to do something positive about it.\n\"I couldn't just do nothing,\" he said.\nHe's getting his hands dirty.\nCall him a \"trash bag half full\" kind of guy.\n\"I'm a hopeful guy,\" he said, trash bags in hand. \"I hope it will get better.\"\nEvery week for the past four months Sweeny has been picking up garbage at the intersection.\nHe has already collected about 100 bags of trash strewn around roadways and homeless camps.\n\"It's crazy stuff,\" Sweeny said. \"Kitchen sinks. Pieces of cars and stuff. We're like two blocks from three schools. Who wants to drive by and look at all this stuff when you're going to school?\"\nAccording to the Department of Ecology, in 2022, 24,000 pieces of litter were found per mile on Washington's urban interstates.\nIn July alone of last year, crews collected 357 tons of trash.\nThe state spends $9 million per year picking up garbage and still can't keep up. Statewide, 18 million pounds of litter are dumped on Washington's roads, parks and recreation areas.\nSweeny hopes his hard work will inspire others to do the same.\n\"It shouldn't just be me doing this, it should be a whole community,\" he said. \"I think if everybody did something in their community for a couple hours a week it would help a lot.\"\nA Department of Ecology study found 26% of the population is causing all of the mess.\nSweeny knows he's fighting an uphill battle, but at least he's fighting.\n\"For a couple of days I'm gonna feel good as I drive by,\" he smiled. \"Then I'll be back.\"\nFor now, Sweeny continues cleaning up his corner, one piece of trash at a time, knowing full well this work will never be done.\nBut he is making a difference -- if only a temporary one.\n\"I guess it'll be my corner for a while,\" Sweeny laughed. \"It is what it is for now.

      "body": "Copy article link\nSave\nOLYMPIA  Two Democrats in the Washington Senate introduced a bill Monday to refund cap-and-trade fuel surcharges to farmers and haulers of agricultural products.\nSen. Mark Mullet, D-Issaquah, said lawmakers promised cap-and-trade would not raise fuel prices for agriculture, but the Department of Ecology failed to keep the promise.\nThey basically screwed it up, he said. Were only running a bill to make Ecology do what theyre supposed to be doing.\nCap-and-trade puts a fee on the consumption of fuels. Lawmakers exempted fuels used to grow and transport farm goods and directed Ecology to find a way to do it.\nEcology blames oil companies for misapplying the law. The oil industry faults Ecology for not writing rules to exempt the fuels.\nMullet said Ecology has passed the buck. I met with Ecology the first week of session and asked, Whats the plan? They didnt plan to do anything, he said.\nTheyre doing everything they can to kill the bill, Mullet said.\nEcology did not respond to a request for comment.\nSenate and House Republicans previously introduced bills to provide refunds. The new bill enjoys sponsorship by majority Democrats.\nSenate Environment and Energy Committee Chairman Joe Nguyen of Seattle co-sponsored the bill with Mullet.\nDigital subscription only $5/mth\nIt was always our intention to exempt (farmers) fuel ... and this legislation affirms our commitment to them as we transition into a cleaner, greener economy, Nguyen said in a statement.\nMullets and Nguyens legislation, Senate Bill 5766, directs Ecology to start taking applications for refunds by Jan. 1.\nI wish it was faster, Mullet said. They (Ecology) felt they were being pushed to do it by January. I dont think they want to do anything.\nFarmers and haulers would have to document they bought fuel for agricultural uses. The bill calls for setting aside $50 million in cap-and-trade auction proceeds for refunds.\nRefunds would be based on the current price of allowances sold at auctions. Every dollar would translate into a 0.8 cent a gallon.\nAllowances sold for $48.50 at the first cap-and-trade auction in February. The reimbursement rate would be 38.8 cents a gallon if the bill were in effect today.\nThe bill also would forbid fuel suppliers or distributors from listing cap-and-trade surcharges on invoices. Mullet said the provision may need work. The idea is to create a standard formula to calculate refunds, he said.\nCap-and-trade taxes fuel consumption, but not in a transparent way. Ecology raised more than $299 million at the first cap-and-trade auction, but its unclear how much consumers will pay.\nWhen lawmakers adopted cap-and-trade in 2021, they told Ecology to determine a method for exempting farm fuels from the tax.\nThe Mullet-Nguyen bill calls for setting up a work group to help Ecology figure out how to do it.\nSign up for our Top Stories newsletter\nSuccess!

Credit: Chris Birmingham, 2012/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY\nA team of environmental scientists at the University of Auckland and Manaaki WhenuaLandcare Research, both in New Zealand, has found that one of the reasons for the declining population of the endangered kkp is a reduction in diet variety. In their study, reported in the journal\nFrontiers in Ecology and Evolution\n, the group examined recent and fossilized bird feces (coprolites) found in caves where kkp live.\nKkp are the only flightless species of parrot. They are also the heaviest. The birds live in caves in New Zealand, and their numbers have been dropping since humans first appeared. Today, there are just a few hundred left. Prior research has shown that they are ineffective at defending themselves against animals introduced by humans and are also poor breeders. In this new effort, the researchers attempted to learn more about the birds in order to save them from extinction.\nThe work involved venturing into the caves where the birds live and collecting coprolites. The researchers pored through samples, which range in age from recent to up to hundreds of years old. Bits of the material were separated, allowing for DNA analysis, so the researchers could determine what sorts of food the birds eat. They found that the birds' diet has become much less diverse over the years.\nContemporary and former kkp distribution, adapted from Boast (2021). Collection sites are plotted, colored by age group: (Red) ancient, (Green) historic, (Blue) modern. Credit:\nFrontiers in Ecology and Evolution\n(2023). DOI: 10.3389/fevo.2023.1058130\nThe analysis showed that today, the birds feed mainly off leaves from rimu forests, but they once ate beech leaves, seeds, mistletoe and other types of vegetation. The researchers suggest the restricted diet is directly related to the caves where they livethe vegetation around them is severely limited. They also note that the birds tend to breed during times when rimu fruit is availableand that only happens every two to five years.\nThe researchers suggest that might be possible to save the birds by increasing the types of vegetation around the caves where they live. They also suggest it might be possible to entice the birds to breed when beech seeds are available, as they likely once did in the past.\nMore information:Alexander P.

      "body": "Interrogating the role art can play as a means of knowledge production in the context of ecological interrelations, and if artists and artworks articulate the web of ecological, cultural, economic, historical, and political relations as legitimate legal narratives in a judicial context, Khoj International Artists' Association's presentation 'In the matter Re: Rights of Nature' directed by Zuleikha Chaudhari, a staged hearing, showcased in Chandigarh recently was unique in multiple ways. Held at the Open Hand monument, it involved retired judges, practicing lawyers, and artists as witnesses.The project foregrounded the Rights Of Nature as an expansion of the Right to Life as enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Following on from an earlier project staged as a Commission of Inquiry under the Commission of Inquiry Act 1952, Landscape As Evidence: Artist As Witness, the latest project employed the format of the NGT (National Green Tribunal) in order to explore \"principles of natural justice\" in the context of environmental justice.  The fictional case, filed by Khoj International Artists' Association and Zuleikha Chaudhari, indicts the Union of India through the Ministry of Environment, the respective State stakeholders, and a fictitious Farmer's Union for their inability to stop stubble-burning in areas of Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi. The hearing staged the arguments put forth by the three parties considering fundamental issues that place both humans and non-humans in polluted ecosystems.  While Chaudhari has worked on staged hearings before too, it was in the year 2007 that she was invited by Khoj to work on a project with them that looked at law, performance, and ecology. It was in that course, the 'artist witnesses' were conceived. \"For me, the broader question has always been 'what does art do, and what does it mean to work on issues and performances on what artists see around them? Outside the art community, for me the question of what performance does and where it lies between the real and lot is an important question,\" Chaudhari tells about the three-hour multilingual presentation (Hindi, Punjabi, and English) that witnessed a full house.  Working with law performance and ecology in 'In the matter Re: Rights of Nature', the project comes specifically from being part of Khoj's 'Where Does the Blue Sky Lie', the umbrella project. \"When Pooja Sood (Director, Khoj) spoke to me, I knew it would be something about air pollution, stubble burning and it seemed like an important thing to be looking at, it's not just a one-off thing. It is a historical issue.\"  The latest project talked about air pollution in Delhi, and stubble burning, but focussed on the idea of what nature means. And what does it mean to say that the ecosystem of Delhi NCR is entitled to its own processes? \"These briefs were developed and discussed and it's a project that has been in the works for almost a year and a half. And yes I think the idea is how one inserts rights of nature into Article 21 (Right to Life) I think this is key as at the moment life in Article 21 only means human life. This is really asking to expand in the non-human because an ecosystem is not just planted; it's humans, insects, and animals. What's critical to think about in general when we ask about the rights of nature, whether it's in an urban setting or agricultural land? These are important and complex landscapes, it's not about a lake or a forest reserve. It is something that is interrelated with humans in deep ways,\" she says.  Chaudhari majored in Theatre Directing and Light Design at Bennington College in the US. She is the granddaughter of (late) Ebrahim Alkazi, eminent Indian theatre director, and daughter of theatre director Amal Allana, former Chairperson of the National School of Drama (NSD) in the capital.  Ask her about the experience of working on this project purely as a theatre director and she says that since 2014, she has been working with law and performance, and looking at law and environment -- conceptually these projects are based around the idea of what is performance theatre and law. Bringing queries that are essentially theatre questions as the performance comes from theatre, and what it means in the context of law, she adds that her processes have changed over a period of time. \"The idea of rehearsal is not putting actors in a room where you improvise a work. I am interested in the larger idea of a rehearsal based on ideas. Normally, things get discarded, and the stress is to focus on a web of interrelated ideas. Here, I wanted to bring artists in conversations with lawyers and look for what merges what emerges from the conversations.\"  But in projects like these, does she witness more theatre in realism now? Admitting that in a way it is a revisitation of the idea of realism taken to another level, she says the people involved are 'who they are' and are performing the ideas.  \"They stick to legal protocols, we have not...",

      "body": "Double-anonymous peer review reduces reviewer bias, finds three-year trial\nReleased:  4-Apr-2023 3:00 PM EDT\nSource Newsroom:\nBritish Ecological Society\nNewswise  Today (4 April) the British Ecological Society has published the results of a three-year randomised trial comparing double and single-anonymous peer review in the journalFunctional Ecology. The findings indicate a reduction in reviewer bias when author identities are anonymised.\nThe three-year randomised trial in the journalFunctional Ecology, provides the most compressive data yet on the effects of anonymising authors during scholarly journal peer review.\nDouble-anonymous peer review, also referred to as double-blind peer review, is where author identities are not disclosed to reviewers. This differs from single-anonymous peer review where reviewers know the identities of the authors, which is more traditional in life science disciplines.\nThe study found that when author identities were anonymised and reviewers did not know whose paper they were reviewing (double-anonymous review), peer review outcomes were similar across author demographics.\nIn contrast, when author identities were known by reviewers (single-anonymous review), outcomes depended on author demographics. Papers with a first author residing in a higher-income country or a country with a higher average English-proficiency received higher ratings from reviewers and were more likely to be invited for revision or resubmission compared to papers with first authors from a lower income country or country with a lower average English-proficiency.\nInterestingly, anonymising author identities had no effect on gender differences in reviewer ratings or editor decisions.\nProfessor Charles Fox, University of Kentucky, lead author of the study and previously the Executive Editor forFunctional Ecologysaid:\nOur trial provides strong evidence that authors from higher-income and/or English-speaking countries receive significant benefits to being identified to reviewers during the peer review process, and that anonymizing author-identities (e.g., double-blind review) reduces this bias, making the peer review process more equitable.\nIts critical for science, and for the scientists involved, that peer review be a fair and unbiased process. The results of this trial will help inform publishers on the best ways to minimise some sources of bias in the publishing process.\nBased on the strong evidence provided from the trial, the British Ecological Society will begin transitioning its journals to mandatory double-anonymous peer review. This will begin withFunctional Ecology,with the other journals published by the BES to follow.\nAndrea Baier, Director of Publishing at the British Ecological Society said:\nThe British Ecological Society is committed to promoting equitable practices in international ecological science. Authors from all over the world submit to our seven journals and it is vitally important that the research we publish is reviewed and selected in the most impartial way, regardless of the authors backgrounds.\nProfessor Rob Freckleton, University of Sheffield and Chair of the British Ecological Societys publications committee said:\nOn behalf of the British Ecological Society, the publications committee supported this important experiment, and from the outset we committed to being led by the results it would produce. We now have the evidence that double-anonymous peer review is an important building block towards greater equity in publishing and we are acting on it.\nAbout the trial\nTo explore how blinding author identities during peer review reduces biases based on author location or gender,Functional Ecologyconducted a large, randomized trial, using real manuscripts submitted from 2019 to 2022. Every research paper submitted to the journal (3739 submissions, 1432 sent for peer review) was randomly assigned to be reviewed double-anonymous or single-anonymous.\nAuthors were required to submit their papers to be reviewed with their identities anonymised. Half of submissions were then randomly chosen to have author details added to the papers by adding a title page with information that identified the authors.\n-ENDS-",

      "body": "William H. Schlesinger\nMost folks who live in the eastern United States, particularly in New England, are likely to have experienced more than one close encounter with White-Tail deer.  In recent years, insurance records suggest as many as 1.2 million collisions between deer and vehicles, costing over $7 billion in repairs.  And, of course, anyone with an outdoor garden knows the frustration of fencing out deer, which like to eat the same vegetables that we do.\nNow, a recent paper by Lior Greenspoon and coworkers documents the overpopulation of deer from a different perspective.  Estimated globally, white-tail deer have the greatest overall population biomass of any wild mammalexceeding that of many species on the plains of Africa.  Forty-five million deer, which can exceed 300 pounds for a male animal, amount to 2.7 million tons of wet biomass worldwide.  In the eastern United States, deer are found at densities sometimes greater than 40 per square mile.  In the Southeast, deer populations have increased from about 200,000 in 1900 to more than 10 million in 2003.\nWhy the increase?   Much of the land in the eastern U.S. is recovering from earlier logging, so that it is inhabited by colonizing trees that provide excellent cover and abundant food for deerbetter than mature forest.  At the same time, natural predators, like wolves, have been exterminated.  Indeed, through hunting and automobiles, humans are really the only remaining predators of significance.\nIn what John Terborgh and his colleagues documented more than 20 years ago, when predators are eliminated from an ecosystem, the populations of herbivores, like deer, explode and overgraze the native vegetation. The familiar browse lines that are seen along the edge of woodlands and the absence of understory vegetation in many areas, are the effects of abundant white-tail deer on the landscape.  In many areas there is a complete failure of trees to regenerate in the understory.\nVarious studies have found that deer help maintain large populations of ticks that plague casual hikers and others who work outdoors.  And recently, serological studies have found that deer serve as a reservoir for SARS-COV-2, which could reinfect humans in the future.\nWhen we manipulate one component of an ecosystem, such as predators, unknown consequences show up in other componentswhat Terborgh called ecological meltdown.  Reducing the population of white-tail deer should be at the top of ecosystem management throughout its range.\n\nReferences\nAlmendinger, T., M. Van Clef, J.F. Kelly, M.C. Allen and C.
